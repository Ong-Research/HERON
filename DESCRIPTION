Description: HERON is a software package for analyzing peptide binding array 
    data. In addition to idenfiying significant binding probes, HERON also 
    provides functions for finding epitopes (string of consecutive peptides 
    within a protein). HERON also calculates significance on the probe,
    epitope, and protein level by employing meta p-value methods.  HERON is
    designed for obtaining calls on the sample level and calculates fractions
    of hits for different conditions.
