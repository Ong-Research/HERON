Description: HERON is a software package for analyzing peptide binding
    array data similiar to pepStat, but with the addition of finding
    epitopes (string of consecutvie peptides within a protein) and
    proteins with significance on a per-sample level.  HERON provides a 
    number of ways to find epitopes across samples and employ meta p-value
    methods to calculate sample-level p-values on the peptide probes, found
    epitopes, and the associated proteins.
