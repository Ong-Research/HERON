\title{HERON: Hierarchical Epitope pROtein biNding}
\description{
HERON is a software package for analyzing peptide binding array data. In
addition to idenfiying significant binding probes, HERON also provides
functions for finding epitopes (string of consecutive peptides within a
protein). HERON also calculates significance on the probe, epitope, and protein
level by employing meta p-value methods. HERON is designed for obtaining calls
on the sample level and calculates fractions of hits for different conditions.
