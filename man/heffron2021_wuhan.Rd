\title{SARS CoV-2 Wuhan Peptide Binding Array Data}
\format{
## `heffron2021_wuhan`
A data frame with 1945 rows and 60 columns. Each column is a pre-processed
binding signal from a serum sample peptide array set for the SARS-CoV-2.
The matrix is a subset of the full matrix and contains sequences from the
membrane, envelope, surface (spike), and nucleocapsid proteins.

The "probe_meta" attribute is a data frame with 1945 rows and 6 columns.
The columns are POSITION - starting position of probe within protein,
PROBE_SEQUENCE - amino acid sequence of probe, SEQ_ID - protein identifier
SEQ_NAME - name of protein, PROBE_ID - combination of protein identifier
and starting position, e.g. prot1;5.

The "sample_meta" attribute is a data frame with 60 rows and 2 columns.
The columns are SAMPLE_NAME - name of the sample which is a column name in
sample matrix and COVID_POSITIVE - whether the sample is positive for
COVID.
